1. First, follow the configuration steps in DanWoodrich/INSTINCT/Instructions - Config.txt
2. AFSC MML users: follow the configuration steps in DanWoodrich/dbuddy_client/README.md (if using dbuddy locally, follow the instructions in DanWoodrich/dbuddy/README.md . Ask Dan Woodrich if unsure) 
3. Make sure R (>4.0.0) is installed 
4. Add ~/R-x.x.x/bin and ~/dbuddy/bin to PATH (see more details on PATH in DanWoodrich/INSTINCT/Instructions - Config.txt) 
5. Make sure you have loaded in submodules, or at least this specific submodule (see DanWoodrich/INSTINCT/Instructions - Config.txt , 1 & 2 under 'Optional')
6. Make sure CONTRIBNAME variable in ~/INSTINCT/etc/INSTINCT.cfg is set to: CONTRIBNAME=instinct_afsc_mml_acoustics
7. Open a command window, and type INSTINCT pull_contrib. Note this will override any files in ~/INSTINCT/lib/user folder if working between submodules or with local files
8. In ~/INSTINCT/lib/user, run the R script Installe.R
	a. Use the CMD terminal to run the R script, or R studio if installed already (donâ€™t
	download it only for this)
	b. To run on CMD terminal, need to search for CMD in windows search bar, run it, navigate to
	~/INSTINCT/lib/user (use an online tutorial for changing directories with CMD)
	c. Once in the right directory, use Rscript Installe.R

The following will require admin privileges:
1. Install the matlab compiler library (2019a). https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html

Optional: if you want to make changes to this submodule:
1. clone this repo to a new directory
2. link the repo in INSTINCT/etc/INSTINCT.cfg as CONTRIBPATH
3. update changes made in ~/INSTINCT/lib/user to submodule with push_user. Add and push changes in the linked repo. Make sure to regularly 'pull_contrib' before editing to make sure your code is up to date (note this will 
override changes not already pushed to repo). 
4. Users of this and other repos can pull your changes by updating submodule in INSTINCT and pulling changes with command 'INSTINCT pull_contrib'
